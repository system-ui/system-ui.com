## About

System UI is an open source organization that houses a [Theme Specification](/theme) for creating interoperable UI components.
It is also the home for the [Theme UI][] and [DesignQL][] libraries that are built upon the foundation of this specification.
The intent behind this specification is to help make UI components, libraries, and tools as interoperable as possible.

If you'd like to get involved, head over to the [GitHub][] project and feel free to comment, open issues, or open PRs.

## Who's Using this Specification

The following design systems and libraries currently adhere to the specification. If you'd like to add your project to this list, please [open a PR](https://github.com/system-ui/system-ui.com).
